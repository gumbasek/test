### Found a bug?

Before you submit a bug, it is the best to search for existing [Issues](/issues). In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. 

If you then still need raise a bug, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Collect the logs with exceptions

We will then take care of the issue and fix any potential bug as fast as possible.
